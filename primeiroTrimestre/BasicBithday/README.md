DU1 - Review Exercise 1 - Java - Git repository - Birthday

Create a Java program for the following scenario by creating a maven project in IntellijIDEA.

Add the project to a Git repository. Create a README.md.

A person wants to reduce the number of candles to be used to celebrate their birthday.
To achieve this, the person is going to set their new age in binary.
Each candle will represent one bit, and the candle will be lit to represent a 1, or extinguished to indicate a 0.
As a result, not only will she use far fewer candles, they won't even have to light them all!
The person is so confident that she will finally be able to blow out all the candles that they are even determined to put their age in seconds.

Input
The program will read, from the standard input, a first number indicating how many test cases will come next.

Each test case is an integer number with the person's age in seconds.

Output
For each test case the program will write the number of lit candles the person will have to put on his birthday cake, knowing that it represents the number in binary.

### Input
Example input
4

1

2

15

Example output

Use Javadoc comments to document the program.

The final version of the project must be in the Git repository.

Execute the program from the command line.

DU1 - Review Exercise 2 - Java command line arguments - Birthday

Create another version of the previous Java program in the same project.

Read input data as command line arguments instead of interactive user input.

Add the new program to the Git repository.

Execute the program from the command line.

Publish the project in GitHub.

DU1 - Review Exercise 3 - Java - Git repository - Steps

Create a Java program for the following scenario by creating a maven project in IntellijIDEA.

Add the project to a Git repository. Create a README.md.

Suppose a person who is able to climb several steps in one go.
This ability has led them to travel the world participating in so-called vertical races, such as the world's oldest and most famous tower race in which participants must climb the 1576 steps of the Empire State Building.
A normal person would need 1576 steps to climb all those steps. Climbing them two at a time, 788 would be enough, and three at a time only 526.

Input
The first number in the input indicates how many test cases are to be processed.

It is followed by a line for each test case, with two numbers between 1 and 1,000,000. The first one indicates the number of steps and the second one indicates how many steps can be climbed at a time.

Output
For each test case the minimum number of jumps needed to climb all the rungs shall be written.

### Input
