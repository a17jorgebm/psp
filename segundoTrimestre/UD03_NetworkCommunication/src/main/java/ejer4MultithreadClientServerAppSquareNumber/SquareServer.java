/***
 * DU3 - Exercise 4 - Multi threaded client-server app - Square a number
 *
 * We want to create a client-server application for squaring integers.
 *
 * The client must send to the server a number entered by the user .
 *
 * The server must square the received number and send back to the client the obtained square  .
 *
 * The user can use the Client to send numbers to the server until they decide to exit the application. You can create a menu to handle this situation.
 *
 * Create a SquareClient class to launch the Client.
 *
 * Create a SquareServer class to launch the Server.
 *
 * Create a SquareClientWorker class for each thread on the Client.
 *
 * Create a SquareServerWorker class for each thread on the Server.
